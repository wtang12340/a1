		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
        My name is William Tang and I work as a web developer. I grew up in Boston and has been interested in computer science
        since high school. I graduated from Boston University 2 years ago with a Computer Science degree and has been getting experience in the field.
        I want to further improve my skills in web development by filling the holes in my knowledge
        by earning a Masters degree at Harvard Extension. Nice to meet everyone.
